# About

Energy Prediction using XGBoost is a project that aims to use machine learning to predict the energy consumption. The project is developed using the Python programming language and the data analysis library Pandas, numerical computing library Numpy, and visualization libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn. The XGBoost algorithm is used for building the machine learning model.

The project involves the analysis of historical energy consumption data. The dataset is first cleaned and preprocessed to remove any missing or inconsistent values.

After cleaning the data, it is split into training and testing datasets. The training dataset is used to train the XGBoost algorithm, while the testing dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the model. The XGBoost algorithm is tuned to achieve the best possible performance, and various metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are used to evaluate the performance of the model.

The project involves extensive visualization of the data to gain insights into the relationship between the various features and energy consumption. Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries are used to create various plots and graphs, which are used to analyze the data and understand the patterns and trends.


Overall, the Energy Prediction using XGBoost project is a valuable tool for predicting energy consumption, which can help in reducing energy costs and promoting sustainable energy use.
